      <p>I'm a software engineer with frontend, backend,
        and fullstack project experience in my back pocket.
        My fascination with the web started from my background in marketing where
        I used Zapier APIs integrated with HubSpot to automate marketing blasts.
        Ever since then, I have wanted to be <em>behind</em> the APIs.
      </p>
      <p>I graduated from a bootcamp and completed projects like an e-commerce website,
        Airbnb for parking, and an EV comparison tool.
      </p>
      <p>These are some of the technologies I worked with:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>JavaScript (ES6)</li>
        <li>Node.js</li>
        <li>React</li>
        <li>PostgreSQL</li>
        <li>Figma</li>
        <li>AWS</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
